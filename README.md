# BigChainDB Hackfest - Berlin, February 2017

This repo contains (some of) the artefacts out of our BigChainDB hackfest.

- *bcdb-iot-feeder*: Python script that receives events from IoT Hub (using the Event Hubs endpoint) and forwards them to BigChainDB using assets/transactions.
- *flask-keyvault*: Python sample that shows how to access Azure Key Vault secrets. (can be used in the future to store various secrets or keys used by the other components)
